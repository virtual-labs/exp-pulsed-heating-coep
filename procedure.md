## Procedure

### Pre-requisite and note : 
To ** "Play Animation" **, you need to add browser extensions that support flash files. 
Here are the required extensions that we suggest -
1) Flash Player
2) Ruffle - Flash Emulator

After adding this extensions you can play animation and perform the experiment.

### Steps :

1. The experiment can be performed in three different modes viz. considering solid state heating, melting and evaporation.
2. One can determine heated volume in solid state, melt state and evaporation state (crater volume).
3. User needs to select the state as well as material.
4. A range of energy values is given and needs to be selected in order to perform the experiment.
5. After performing the experiment graph can be plotted in order to understand the response over a set of values
