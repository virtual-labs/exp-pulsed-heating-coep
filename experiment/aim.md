### To acquaint the user to pulsed-heating technique and its implications, using conduction mode of heat transfer, differing from continuous conventional heating.

#### Objective
1. To study the Electrical Discharge Machining process
2. To understand the effect of variation of pulse time, leading towards variation in desired output
3. To acquire knowledge regarding erosion characteristics in EDM
